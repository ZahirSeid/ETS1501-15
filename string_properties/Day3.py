# string_properties

print(string.index('e')) # this method is used to show the index of a character or string we have previously seen this kind of functionality with .find() method

# so if you are wondering what is the difference of b/n those two; 
"""
the major difference between find() and index() methods in Python is how they handle cases when the substring is not found. The find() method returns -1 in such cases, while index() method raises a ValueError.

When to use find() and index()?

    Use find() when we need to check if a substring exists and do not want to handle exceptions.
    Use index() when we are sure that the substring exists or we want an exception to be raised if it doesnâ€™t exist. (GeeksforGeeks, 2024)

print(string.startswith('H')) # this method is used to check if a string start with the specific character we defined in the parameteer
# on our case we checked if it really starts with 'H' and it returns with True (boolean value)

# lets see if its case sensetive; output we will be shown at the end or run it yourself to check it
print(string.startswith('h'))


print(string.endswith('i')) # this method does the opposite fo the .startswith() method, it checks what character is at the ned of the string 


# now lets chekc if they work on more than one character
print(string.startswith('He'))

print(string.endswith('lo'))
